# XG Performance Optimization Report

## Summary
Analysis of the XG codebase revealed several performance optimization opportunities across parsing, type checking, compilation, and runtime execution.

## Identified Optimizations

### 1. Engine Function Map Caching (IMPLEMENTED)
**File**: engine.py, lines 35-40
**Issue**: function_map() recreates the same dictionary on every call
**Impact**: High - called frequently during compilation and execution
**Fix**: Cache the result and invalidate when program changes

### 2. Parser String Allocation Optimization
**File**: parser.py, lines 105-111, 113-128
**Issue**: Excessive string slicing and temporary string creation in lexer
**Impact**: Medium - affects compilation time for large programs
**Potential Fix**: Use string indices instead of slicing, implement string interning

### 3. Type Checker Dimension Resolution
**File**: typechecker.py, lines 302-310
**Issue**: Inefficient dimension resolution with potential cycles
**Impact**: Medium - affects type checking performance
**Potential Fix**: Optimize resolution algorithm, add cycle detection

### 4. AST Serialization Overhead
**File**: ast.py, multiple locations
**Issue**: Redundant dictionary creation in to_ir/from_ir methods
**Impact**: Low-Medium - affects engine save/load operations
**Potential Fix**: Lazy serialization, object pooling

### 5. Interpreter Type Validation
**File**: interpreter.py, lines 205-234
**Issue**: Repeated type validation and tensor shape checking
**Impact**: Medium - affects runtime performance
**Potential Fix**: Cache validation results, optimize tensor checks

## Type System Bugs Found
- typechecker.py: DimensionValue type mismatches in dim_bindings
- interpreter.py: ResultValue class method conflicts and type errors

## Implementation Details

The Engine function_map caching optimization was selected for implementation because:
- Clear performance impact (called frequently during compilation/execution)
- Safe to implement (no breaking changes)
- Easily testable and verifiable
- Demonstrates optimization methodology for future improvements

The caching implementation uses lazy initialization that's thread-safe and maintains backward compatibility.
